Is there any chance for metaverse on 2020?

Nobody really knows what metaverse is. You're gonna go to those workshops, conferences. 
All right, they're gonna talk all day all night they're gonna show you pictures, they're 
gonna show you video games, they're gonna show you avatars, but nobody will actually know 
what metaverse is. And my prediction is that everybody's gonna talk about it but nobody 
has any idea what it is and a lot venture capitalists, a lot of investors are gonna put a 
lot of money into metaverse companies, and then they will get nothing out of it, and it's 
basically a big giant scam (trò bịp khổng lồ). All right, that is my prediction. But that 
is not to say that all this money going to metaverse companies will not produce something. 
Because I believe that by investing in metaverse companies, we will find solutions to problems 
using metaverse related technology (bằng cách sd cn liên vũ trụ ảo). All of these technologies 
will find practical use in real life. (Sẽ dc áp dụng thực tiễn)
