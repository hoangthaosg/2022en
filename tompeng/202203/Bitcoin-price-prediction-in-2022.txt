Bitcoin price prediction in 2022

What do investors do, what do people do when it's a time of uncertainty (trong boi canh bat on nay). 
They buy US dollars, and they buy gold? You can expect that (ban se thay rang) gold prices and US 
dollars will go up. What about bitcoin? Well bitcoin is not a real thing. I continue to say that, 
I know there will be people argue with me about that (toi biet se co nguoi tranh cai voi toi). 
But in time of crisis (boi canh khung hoan) in time of uncertainty (boi canh bat on), people are 
not going to put the money at least the big institutional investors (it nhat voi cac chu dau tu lon) 
are not going to put the money in something that is quite volatile (co tinh bien dong cao) such as bit coin. 
You can expect bitcoin value to go down this year, so we have not seen the bottom yet (muc gia thap nhat). 
Bitcoin prices will go down this year.
