What will the stock market be like in 2022?

In the last two years, because there's a lot of cash flowing around (luan chuyen),
a lot of people put their money in the stock market. The stock market is already overvalued (da vuot nguong gia)
With the current uncertainty (tinh hinh bat on hien nay) and also most companies are not producing the returns on their invesment. (khong thu lai duoc von bo ra)
So you'll see that a lot of people will take their money out of the stock market, because interest rate (ty le lai suat) will be high due to high inflation (lam phat cao). 
They'd rather put the money in something else rather than the stock market. (tha ... con hon ...)
You will see stock market indexes drop (chi so ck tuot doc). The stock markets worldwide will not perform well. (se khong khoi sac)
