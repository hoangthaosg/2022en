Electric car will be the new trend in near future?

With the gas prices, with the oil prices going up, and what that means is that more and more 
people are going to be interested in electric cars globally (khắp toàn cầu). So the move to 
electric cars is already happing in europe and in u.s, and I know that most of my friends 
don't want to buy gas cars anymore, they only want to buy electric cars. Because one they're faster, 
two they're cheaper and they're just  better for the environment. 
Most of people do it for those reasons, and now gas is going to be super expensive, 
and you're going to see people across the world (khắp thế giới) adopting (chuyển sang chấp nhận) 
electric cars even faster, and yes also in Viet Nam more and more people going to buy electric car, 
and VN has a good selection of domestically made electric car by vin fast group. You're gonna see 
more and more electric cars in Vietnam, and you're going to start to see electric charging stations 
in VN as well.
