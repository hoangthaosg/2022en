Get rich by saving money is stupid

Let's say (giả dụ) if you put 1$ 2$ everyday, that's like (nó sẽ) 20k or 40k into a 
saving plan or mutual fund (quỹ tương hỗ), everyday for the rest of your life for the 
next 40,50,60 years, and then that gets you (nó giúp bạn) to a millionaire when you're 
65. Is that really the best way? Are you gonna be alive when you're 65. Are you sure 
when youre 65, like your fk arm is still gonna work, that your fk liver (lá gan chết tiêt) 
is still gonna work? Are you sure when you're 65 you're not gonna be carried around (dìu dắt) 
by a fk nurse. Because you can't fk walk. Waiting 30,40,50 to reach financial stability 
(ổn định tc) is not my idea of smart. It's fk stupid. (Ngu bỏ mẹ ra). I am not saying that
 you should be looking for get rich quick schemes (kế làm giàu nhanh chóng). I'm not saying
  that you should go out and buy the fk lottery ticket and become a millionaire overnight. 
  Because that's also ridiculous (cực kỳ lố bịch). But waiting 30,40,50 years to make your 
  first millions is also stupid. Stupid x3. What I want you to do is look at how to achieve 
  financial independence (tự do tc), financial success (thành công tc) in next 2 to 5 years.
   Not 1 month not 40 years. There are 3 ways to reach financial success in 3 to 5 years. 1, 
   you find a profession (nghề) that pays you based on the results, not based on time. 
   Number 2, way to do it is become an enterpreneur (doanh nhân) like myself. Third option 
   is the best for most people which is to become an intrapreneur (lanh dao tiem nang)
