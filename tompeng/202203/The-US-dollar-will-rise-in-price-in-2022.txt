The US dollar will rise in price in 2022

Because there's right now a war going on in Russia and Ukraine, we expect (lường được) US dollar 
to increase in value. This is not a prediction I would have made 2 months ago. Most governments 
in the world have printed a lot of money including the U.S government, so the theory is that the 
US dollar will actually go down in value, so the currencies of other countries can now trade more 
US dollar than before. However because the war just started in Russia and Ukraine. And when there 
is a war (khi còn chiến tranh), when there is a lot of uncertainty (khi còn nhiều điều bất ổn) 
what happens is that (chuyện sẽ xảy ra là) investors like to be conservative (sẽ trở nên thận trọng) 
and buy US dollars even though (kể cả) there was a lot of US dollar printed in the last year. 
You're going to see the US dollar rise in value, in fact this is already happening in the last few days. 
If you look at the chart for VND against the US dollar (bản đổi giá), you'll see that the US dollar 
is already increasing value. This trend will continue for the rest of the year.
