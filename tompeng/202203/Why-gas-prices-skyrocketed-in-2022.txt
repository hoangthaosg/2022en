Why gas prices skyrocketed in 2022?

We talked about the Russian and Ukrainian war, Russia is a major producer of oil and gaz. 
They supply most of the Europe in term of oil and gaz, they're also a major wheat producer
 in the world. And as Russia is being sanctioned (trung phat) by Western world, they now can 
 no longer trade their product, the services with the rest of the world. Because the Western 
 world cut them off (loai ho ra), they're disconnected from the swift banking system, that 
 means they cannot transact money with the rest of the world. That mean no more oil, gaz 
 coming from Russia, that means no more wheat coming from Russia. This is definitely going 
 to increase energy prices around the world so that means you're expected to see (sẽ thấy) 
 higher gaz prices at the pump where you fill up (đổ xăng) your motobike, when you fill up 
 your car. That means you're going to spend more money heating your homes or turn on air 
 conditioning. Everything will be more expensive oil, gaz, electricity.
