    <p>
        <i>Scan the article,. Is is OK to use a cell phone an a movie theater? in restaurant? on the street?</i> <br>
        What do these things have in common: a stranger's personal problems, details about a business meeting, the food in someone's refrigerator, someone's medical issues, and a private argument? These are all things you hear about when the people around you don't practice good cell phone etiquette! <br>
        Most people find cell phones a necessity in their day-to-day lives. But we've all sat next to someone talking too loudly, listening to loud music, or playing a loud beeping game on a cell phone. But a recent people are annoyed by cell phone rudeness, most admit to doing it, too. What can you do to practice better etiquette? Here a few rules: <br>
        - Off means off! Respect the rules of restaurants and other public places. If a sign says "No cell phone," don't use your phone - for anything. <br>
        - Keep private conversations private! Speak softly and for short time. Observe the 3-meter (10-feet) rule - stay away from other people. <br>
        - Light off, phone off! Never take calls or send text messages in a theater, at the movies, or at a performance. Turn your phone or your ringer off. <br>
        - Pay attention! Talking or texting while driving is dangerous. Listening to music with headphones while driving is dangerous. Crossing the street while playing a game or checking your email is dangerous. You get the picture. <br>
        Cell phones have become mini-computers that people depend on 24 hours a day. But don't let yours become a nuisance - or a danger - to others! Next time you're getting ready to use yours, stop and consider the people around you.
