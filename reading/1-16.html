    <h4>Setting Personal Goals</h4>
    <p>
        <i>Look at the list in the article. Which of these areas of your life would you like to change or improve?</i> <br>
        <b>Goal Setting</b> <br>
        Ask any top athlete or successful businessperson and they will tell you the importance of setting goals. Goal setting can motivate you and give you life direction. It seems easy, right? Just write down a list of things you want to achieve and then do them. Well, it's not that easy! <br>
        Effective goal setting happens on several levels. First, you create a big picture of waht you want to do with your life. At this point, you decide what large-scale goals you want to achieve. Second, you divide these into smaller and smaller tasks. Third, you put the smaller tasks into a rough time line. Finally, once you have your plan, you start working to achieve it. <br>
        How do you know what your large-scale goals are? These questions can help you get started. <br>
        - <b>Career</b> What level do you want to reach in your career? <br>
        - <b>Family</b> What kind of relationship do you want with the people in your family? <br>
        - <b>Community Service</b> How do you want to give back to your community? <br>
        - <b>Financial</b> How much money do you want to earn? How much do you want to save? <br>
        - <b>Creative</b> Do you want to achieve any artistic goals? <br>
        - <b>Physical</b> How will you stay in good physicak shape throughout your life? <br>
        - <b>Education</b> What do you want to learn? How will you learn it? <br>
        - <b>Recreation</b> How do you want to enjoy yourself? <br>
        <b>Process</b> <br>
        Write down your goals and think about them carefully. Are they realistic? <br>
        How important are they? <br>
        Rank them in order from most important to least importance. <br>
        Then follow the process above to make your long-term plan. Remember, your goals can change with time. <br>
        Look at them regularly and adjust them if  necessary. <br>
        And be sure your goals are things you hope to achieve, not things others want.
