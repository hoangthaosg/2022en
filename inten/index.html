                    Most of us spend between 60-80% of our waking hours working,
                    so it's important to find a job that brings true satisfaction. If you
                    haven't found it yet, then don't give up. Keep looking until you find
                    a job that you love doing.

                    I'm a recent psychology graduate, and I'm very keen to work for a company like yours, because
                    of your excellent reputation.' <br>

                    will have a good first degree in marketing or a

                    of working in the marketing department of a

                    learnt some nice tricks to help me organise

                    demonstrates a clear, confident and professional
                    approach, which helped her get an interview.
                    Her chances of getting the job appear strong,

                    <u>2.a Silvia Carnali is approaching the end of her degree course at

                        office, for some advice. Listen to their conversation and, in pair, discuss
                        the following questions.
                    </u>
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Sophie]: Hey Silvia. How are you? What have you been up to? I haven't seen you for ages. <br>
                    [Silvia]: I'm fine, Sophie. I'm actually looking for a job at the moment. <br>
                    [Sophie]: Yeah? So how's it going? <br>
                    [Silvia]: Not that great, to be honest. I've got a few ideas for possible jobs but I'm not really sure 
                    what sort of work I want to do, or what I'd be really good at. <br>
                    [Sophie]: I see. In my experience you've got to work out what you want to do before you start 
                    thinking about where you want to work. So, start by thinking about the things you like doing, or
                    what you're interested in. <br>
                    [Silvia]: Well, I'm interested in sustainability and I enjoy working with people. <br>
                    [Sophie]: Exactly. So you'd probably enjoy a job that included both of these things. Then,
                    after you've worked out your interests, the next step is to think about the skills you've got 
                    that can be used in almost any job, things like communication and people skills. Everything that 
                    you've managed to do successfully at work or university needed skills to get these things done. 
                    These are your transferable skills. <br>
                    [Silvia]: But how do I work out what my transferable skills are? <br>
                    [Sophie]: I try to think aabout something I've done that was successfully, where my actions have made
                    a difference, and then try to identify the skills I used. <br>
                    [Silvia]: Hmm. I can do that I think <br>
                    [Sophie]: Also, a lot of people these days use personality tests to find out more about the type  
                    of person they are and the types of jobs that are suited to them. There are quite a lot of them on 
                    the Internet if you're interested. <br>
                    [Silvia]: That sounds interesting. I'll give it a go, and see what it comes up with. <br>
                    [Sophie]: Okay, but don't take these tests too seriously - they're just there to give you some 
                    ideas and suggestions. At the end of the day, the only person who really knows who you are 
                    and what type of job is right for you is you. And remember, it's not just about finding a job that 
                    you'd be good at. You need to find a job that you'll enjoy, one that you'll love doing.


                </p>
                <p>
                    1. What is the first thing Sophie suggests Silvia does? <br>
                    Sophie suggests Silvia works out what she wants to do by thinking about what she likes 
                    doing and what she's interested in. <br>
                    2. How does Sophie identify her transferable skills? <br>
                    She thinks about something she's done that was successful, and then tries to identify the 
                    skills she used. <br>
                    3. Does Sophie think personality tests are very important? <br>
                    No, she says that Silvia shouldn't take them too seriously. <br>
                    4. What is the final piece of advice Sophie gives Silvia? <br>
                    A successful job research is not just about finding a job that you would be good at, but 
                    about finding a job that you will love doing.

                    The first thing you need to do when starting the job-hunting process is a self-assessment 
                    of your own strengths and weaknesses. This process will help you identify the skills,
