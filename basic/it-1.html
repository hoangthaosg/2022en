                        DataPro Inc. is growing, and so our workload is increasing. But our IT department is not dealing
                        with this increase effectively. So I am dividing the IT department into three sections: quality
                        assurance, data processing and information security. The reponsibilities of each section are: <br>
                        Quality assurance <br>
                        - Testing hardware <br>
                        - Providing technical support <br>
                        Data processing <br>
                        - Writing code <br>
                        - Organizing data <br>
                        Information Security <br>
                        - Encoding online data transfers <br>
                        - Updating security software <br>
                        These changes are not simple or easy. But smaller groups deal with tasks more efficiently
                        than larger ones. See your supervisors for your new section assignment. <br>

                        Re: TEI Computers? <br>
                        Thanks for including TEI Inc. in your article on workplace
                        technology. We have many types of computers at our disposal.
                        First, all employees receives PDAs, and desktop computers. But we
                        only use those for word processing and spreadsheets. Of course,
                        some programs are too powerful for desktops. So many employees
                        use the faster workstations. And we do have a few laptops and 
                        handheld PCs. However, employees only use them on business
                        trips. Most employees just answer email with their cell phones. The
                        new server provides acceess to all printers. Finally, our mainframe
                        processes our largest data files. No need for a supercomputer yet! <br>
                        Regards, <br>

                        Step #1: First, gather your parts. These include a motherboard, power

                        drive, and disk drive. <br>
                        Step #2: Next, Attach the motherboard to the case. Then, connect the
                        processor to the motherboard's primary socket. <br>
                        Step #3: Attach the heat sink and cooling fan to the processor. <br>
                        Step #4: Insert the RAM card into an open memory slot. Put any expansion
                        cards into the expansion slots. <br>
                        Step #5: Connect your hard drive to the motherboard and power supply. <br>

                        Network Troubleshooting <br>
                        People often call IT professionals about network connectiion problems.
                        But many problems are easy to fix without help. First, reconnect any
                        loose CAT-5 cable connections. Next, investigate IP address issues.
                        This group of numbers allows communication on the Internet.
                        Renewing your DHCP fixes most IP problems. Next, check the
                        router. The router links LANs to the Internet. Make sure the
                        router's configuration is correct. WLANs have other problems.
                        Interference often blocks their wireless signals. But there is a
                        simple solution. Just move the router away from walls and
                        metals. Finally, cycle the network. Turn all equipment off for a full minute and then restart.

                        Nowadays, anyone can edit graphics. But new users encounter many difficulties. Here are some common problems and solutions: <br>
                        - Problem: The image is dark or has a strange tint. <br>
                        - Cause: Poor exposure or bad lighting. <br>
                        - Solution: Adjust the contrast using a graphic editing program. <br>
                        - Problem: There is white space around the image. <br>
                        - Solution: Crop the picture. This removes unnecessary parts. <br>
                        - Problem: The photograph is blurry. <br>
                        - Cause: Low resolution. <br>
                        - Solution: Increase the number of pixels in the image. This makes it sharper. Or resize the picture and make it
                        smaller. Also, save the photo as a JPEG file. This format creates high quality photographs.

                        Subject: Purchase Request <br>
                        Mr Smith, <br>
                        At present, we travel a lot to meet with our business partners. I
                        propose that we use videoconferencing instead. It saves time
                        and reduces costs. We only need a webcam to do basic
                        videoconferencing. However, a dedicated system is even better.
                        It allows us to do multipoint videoconferences. And it supports
                        document sharing. It also has an echo-cancellation feature. <br>
                        The system comes with a camera and TV monitor. It also comes
                        with a codec, but we need to order a video bridge separately. We
                        also need to make sure we have high bandwidth Internet access.
                        Still, it offers big savings. Let me know your thoughts. <br>

                        Subject: Lowest Price Affiliate Program <br>
                        Dear Miss Jackson, <br>
                        Our advertising at brick and mortar gaming shops is not producing video
                        game equipment sales. Those consumers are much more active in
                        e-commerce. So, we at BargainEquipment.com want TFC Gaming to
                        become an affiliate. Our program works in the following manner. You
                        display our banner when customers view their shopping cart. This directs
                        traffic our way. TFC Gaming earns a percentage of sales from that traffic.
                        We pay a smaller percentage for increases in page views without sales. <br>
                        Our FAQs explain that affiliates are not responsible for our products. We
                        do ask that affiliates obtain a digital certificate with our preferred certificate authority. <br>
                        Contact me with any questions. <br>
                        Regards, <br>
                        Mark Johnson <br>

                      Certain memory requirements are necessary to install and run ClearPic. Check that the
                      coomputer has at least 500 MB of RAM available. For optimal performance, make sure the computer's
                      CPU has a bit size of at least 32 bits. It should run at a bus speed of 800 MHz. <br>
                      There are sevveral options to fix problems with limited memory. One, is to limit the number of programs running at
                      the same time. <br>
                      Another, is to increase the aamount of RAM. First, determine whether your computer uses SIMMs or DIMMs. Make sure that
                      the memory's bus speed matches that of the computer. Purchase the appropriate amount of RAM
                      and attach it to the motherboard. <br>
                      You can also increase your coomputer's virtual memory. This temporarily stores data on a
                      paging file on the computer's hard drive. To add virtual memory, click on the "My Computer" icon.
                      Under "Properties," increase the maximum memory amount.

                      A: How can I fix that? <br>
                      B: By increasing your computer's virtual memory. That way, the pagin file size will be increased and there will be more space. <br>
                      A: Great! So how do I increase the memory? <br>
                      B: Click on the "My Computer" icon under "Properties" and just increase the maximum memory by half. <br>

                        Mr. Daniels, <br>
                        As the head of the computer programming department, I feel that we need to update the
                        department's resources. This includes our programmers. Most of our programmers are
                        comfortable with the C, C++, and Java computer languages. We even have one programmer who
                        ccan use C#. But we don't have anyone proficient in Assembler. I think we need some programmers
                        who are familiar with it. That way, we can translate between programs more easily. <br>
                        In addition, we have two programmers who specialize in BASIC. This language is in decline
                        and will probably be phased out soon. <br>
                        Some of our machines are getting older, too. A few computers need their compilers and linkers
                        updated. Otherwise, they'll never be able to convert to machine code efficiently. One of our older CPUs
                        cannot multi-thread very well. As you know, the programming department is very iimportant to this
                        company's future. Please help us stay updated. <br>
                        Thanks, <br>

                      A: Good morning. I noticed that my bill increased after switching from Mindeye to Websurf. <br>
                      B: What service do you have? <br>
                      A: Just broadband Internet. <br>
                      B: Mmm, well, That's why there has been an increase. We're installing new T-3 lines. <br>
                      A: How does that affect my billing? <br>
                      B: T-3 lines are expensive, so we've had to increase the rates. Howevver, it allows for greater bandwidth. <br>
                      A: I'm not sure that justifies the price hike. <br>
                      B: Well, it does have other benefits too. There's Live tech support and you get free antivirus software. Also, you can log into any of our hotspots at no extra cost. <br>
                      A: I see. Then it might be worth the higher bill.

                      Name: Harold Gibbons <br>
                      Department: IT <br>
                      Suggestion: <br>
                      The IT department is in desperate need of new storage devices. To begin, we need a group of hand
                      drives arranged in an array. That means we'll also need RAID software. Just last week, an engineer
                      lost months of data in a drive failure. An array will help us avoid such costly losses in the future. <br>
                      Furthermore, many employees are still using outdated devices like CD-Rs, CCD-RWs and floppy 
                      disks to traansfer files. Providing each engineer with at least a USB flash drive and a zip drive would
                      be much more efficient. Some employees do use their own drives. But state-of-art storage
                      devices should be provided by the company. <br>
                      Finally, GenTech Systems would do well to upgrade the main data backup. We are still using magnetic
                      tape. Even using data compression, the memory storage density of magnetic tape can't compare
                      to modem technology. A 2TB SATA drive could store more data at a fraction of the cost.

                      A: No, they weren't approved because management thought they seemed too expensive. <br>
                      B: I see. What about the main data backup? <br>
                      A: Yes, we were interested in the saviings you mentioned. We just need you to comr up with a more detailed proposal. <br>

                      This weekend Compumart is cutting prices on hardware to make room for new models. <br>
                      We have digital cameras for both the caasual shooter annd the professional. With CCDs, our cameras take
                      pictures up to 14 megapixels, 30x optical zoom and 5x digital zoom. All sale cameras feature flash memory - you can
                      connect to any computer to print out your best snapshots. <br>
                      We have low prices on both inkjet printers and laser printers. Our high-end models have calibration settings for professional-grade
                      photo prints. Some of our models are all-in-one packages that include scanning and fax. <br>
                      We're also selling stand-alone scanners. Scan photoos and documents at resolutions of up to 4800 DPI. Don't forget a transparency adapter
                      for scanning slides. Scanning multiple documents? Pick up an automatic document feeder and let the machine do the work for you. <br>
                      Compumart is staying open late all weekend, just for you. Arrive early to get the hardware you need.

                      Georgiia Electronics is recalling its Model X.1 MP3 players/ An error occurs as the players attempt
                      to decode AAC files. When playlists containing AAC files are opened, the bitrate on aall files
                      slows down. Players will eventually freeze in these situations. <br>
                      This issue also affects the Model X.2 player, but a recall is not necessary. Georgia Electronics has
                      created a drivver to correct the problem in Model X.2 players. This driver may be downloaded free
                      of charge from the company's website. it must then be uploaded to the MP3 player through the
                      included dock. The driver requires less than one gigabyte of capacity on the MP3 plaayer's hard drive. <br>
                      Unfortunately, Model X.1 players will not accept new drivvers and therefore cannot be fixed.
                      Georgia Electronics will refund the full price that consumers paid for the Model X.1. Visit
                      www.georgiaelec.com for details and downloads.

                      ClarkAndrews00: Sorry to contact you with an instant message. But email doesn't seem to be working right now. 
                      I never got a confirmation on the message I sent last week. <br>
                      SandyHammond: We never received that. Did you send it with attachment? <br>
                      ClarkAndrews00: Yes, I attached my order receipt. <br>
                      SandyHammond: It must have ended up in my spam folder. I apologize for the confusion. <br>
                      ClarkAndrews00: It's okay. What is the status of my shipment? <br>
                      SandyHammond: Unfortunately, we're having technical difficulty scanning the product EPCs.
                      However, we have UPC products ready to ship immediately. <br>
                      ClarkAndrews00: Those will be fine. We have equipment that can read barcodes. <br>
                      SandyHammond: Do you have a PDA or a smartphone? We could update you via email. <br>
                      ClarkAndrews00: I have a cell phone, but my data plan doesn't support email. Voicemail or text messages will work. <br>
                      SandyHammond: I'll text you then. What's the number? <br>
                      ClarkAndrews00: 555-9854. Thanks.

                        Subject: Gaming/Social Networking Markets <br>
                        Gaming and social networking sites offer exciting markets for advertising the new line of Centro
                        computers. Their popularity ensures that many people will view the ads. When people talk together online, we
                        want them to see and discuss the new Centro. <br>
                        A social networking site lets us create a profile and handle related to the new coomputer. We will update
                        people about it in posts that appear in our news feed. We could also have a link to a blog with information
                        about the Centro. People will be able to discuss the computer in a forum that we set up. <br>
                        Gaming sites are another market we should use. Most Massively multiplayer online role-playing games
                        (MMORPG) feature virtual worlds. These worlds allow us to create billboards that advertise our new
                        computers. We can also create avatars relating to the Centro that people can interact with. <br>
                        These sites present unique opportunites for marketing. Please take advantage of them when advertising the new Centro computers.

                      A: Actually yes. We've just got new pop-up blockers. <br>
                      B: Ah. Well, those are preventing the VPN from making a connection in a new window. <br>
                      A: How do I fix the problem? <br>

                      To: Carl [carl@email.com] <br>
                      From: Lisa [lisa@powell-technologies.com] <br>
                      Subject: Technical Problems with New Robot <br>
                      Carl,
                      The robotics team here at Powell Technologies is currently developing an autonomous, serial robot. Its main
                      function is to assist in packaging aand sealing large boxes at factories. However, we are having some technical problems. I
                      know you've worked on robots before. I'm hopiing you have some advice for solving the problem. <br>
                      The robot consists of a manipulator with joints and an end-effector at the top. This acts like a
                      hand. There is an enabling device on the robot that allows it to move. The operator uses a pendant to
                      control the robots actuators. This creates the drive power that makes the robot move. The enabling
                      device appears to be working. But we cannot get the actuators to respond. I looked over the dynamic model
                      and didn't find any errors. Do you think there is a problem with the equality constraint? I would greatly appreciate
                      any help. <br>
                      Thanks, <br>

                      Will Heuristics Lead to Consciousness? By Peter Smith<br>
                      Computers perform complex calculations that no human could complete. Yet, they remain unable to
                      think for themselves. That's something cognitive scientists want to change. Their research focuses
                      on two types of thinking: case based and model based reasoning. Case based reasoning
                      compares similar problems. Model based reasoning examines cause and effect. But these different
                      approaches have the same problem. Their algorithms, like most rules, aren't always right. <br>
                      That's where heuristics comes in. With heuristics, computers are avoiding that problem. Instead of
                      following rigid guidelines like regular algorithms, heuristics search for acceptable solutions. As these
                      modified algorithms improve, machine learning leaps forward. Advanced computer agents and
                      robots now find solutions independently. Pattern reccognition has even made computer vision
                      possible. The range of what robots and computerrs can do grows each day. The invention of a self
                      learning computer may soon be possible.

                    As Apple grows in popularity, the Mac versus PC debate continues. Many businesses experience trouble choosing
                    between the two. However, businesses must realize that each computer is suited for different needs. <br>
                    The two differ most in their operating systems. With a PC you have a variety of OS options from Microsoft and other
                    sources. Macs come with one of the proprietary Apple OSes like OS X. You can install Windows on a Mac, but
                    many users perfer the Mac OS regardless. <br>
                    Macs have proven themselves vital in publishing, particularly the prepress process. Mac has superior typography and
                    color matching. Oncce printed, products look exactly as good as they do on the computer screen. <br>
                    Meanwhile, PCs are noted for their fast processing speed and adaptability. Users can customize a PC to their needs.
                    Additionally, their video subsystems are more powerful. This makes PCs desirable for game designers and others who need
                    advanced graphics. <br>
                    However, both computers have their limitations. While PCs are cheaper, they are also more susceptible to viruses.
                    Macs usually cost more but are less susceptible to computer viruses. However, Macs tend to have fewer third-party
                    software options than PCs. Businesses need to consider such concerns and make the right decision when
                    buying computers for their companies.

                    Subject: Switching to Linux <br>
                    Over in the IT department we've received complaints about the office's computer. The hardware itself is fine. The problem, I believe, is the
                    operating system. The system is rife with communication errors and virus threats. Then there's the fortune we spend on upgrading our
                    software every year. That's why I'm suggesting we switch to Linux or some other OS related to Unix. For example, Ubuntu is very popular
                    with users. Linux works with any hardware including both Macs and PCs. <br>
                    Linux is free, open source and many of its programs have a free software license. We can get Linux distributions from
                    vendors that have entire software packages that we can use. For example, OpenOffice does everything that Microsoft Office does. <br>
                    I've talked to many staff members about this already. Some expressed concern with the interface. Specifically, most people
                    I talked with thought Linux required entering command lines into a terminal. Actually, many Linux operating systems use a
                    graphical interface just like the average desktop operating systems. <br>
                    As for networking, Linux ccomes with a program called Samba. This program allows Linux to interact with Windows-based
                    clients. This means we don't have to worry about printer trouble over the network once the TCP/IP protocol is reconfigured. <br>
                    Please let me know if you have any follow up questions. <br>

                    A: Hi Jerry. Have you got a minute? I want to talk about that Linux idea. I assume we still have to buy antivirus software that works wiith Linux? <br>
                    B: That's the thing - even the security software is free. <br>
                    A: I see. I'm still not comfortable losing Microsoft Office. <br>
                    B: We don't have to. OpenOffice is actually compatible with Office and other programs. <br>
                    A: My other concern is printer trouble. I don't want to install Linux and have our equipment suddenly stop working. <br>
                    B: That's why we'll get that Samba program. The print server will act as if nothing changed. <br>
                    A: That sounds too easy. Surely there's something else to it. <br>
                    B: Actually, I'll have to recconfigure the TCP/IP protocols, but that's a small task.

                    Subject: New Client <br>
                    All, <br>
                    The owner of Dartmouth Enterprises signed a contract today to secure our web design services. His company specializes in
                    CAD for manufacturing facilities. He'll be sending us the information he wants inccluded in the website soon. In the
                    meantime, he's told us what his requirements are for this project. <br>
                    First, he stressed a very professional appearance, so that means no applets. He doesn't want small applications cluttering up his
                    page. It also means no anchors, so all navigation should be done through the menus. <br>
                    Second, he wants separate sections for employees and clients. For his employees, he'd like an electronic bulletin board to
                    streamline communication and a CBT section to keep his employees up-to-date with new training requirements. For his
                    clients, all he requires are a helpful FAQs section and a multimedia section with a media player showcasing his
                    compaany's capabilities. He'll send us a DVVD wiith the footage and images he wants included. We'll need to convert it to an 
                    MPEG. He doesn't want us using a Flash player because he doesn't think the quality is good enough. <br>
                    The rest is up to you, but remember our emphasis on reliability. <br>

                    Mr. Tobin, <br>
                    I'm writing to you today on behalf of several employees with a request to
                    start a telecommuting program here at Zone Solutions. To do so will require
                    changes, but they would ultimately benefit our company. <br>
                    I suggest that we invest in Basecamp. It's a web-based software package.
                    Regardless of where we're working, it will increase productivity. Basically, we
                    would centralize all projects, communication and updates. <br>
                    Basecamp opens in any browser, so employees can use it from home
                    or the office. And it's easy to navigate, so there's no training required.
                    Color-coding identifies different projects. The dashboard displays
                    recently accesses files, so we can all see what is being worked on.
                    The project gallery allows everyone to toggle quickly between files.
                    And a message board is updated in real time to facilitate rapid exchanges. <br>
                    In addition to Basecamp,free Skype software can be downloaded
                    for any communications that require speaking person to person. We
                    can have conference calls with clients around the world without
                    even needing a phone. Should you require specific details, I would
                    be haappy to discuss the issue with you. Additionally, both 
                    Backpack and Skype offer tours with detailed informatiion about their products. <br>
                    I look forward to your response. <br>

                    (Wilmington) - Donald Greene has been arrested by Interpol on computer hacking charges. Interpol claims that Greene, a
                    computer hacker, planted viruses on unwitting host computers. It is thought that Greene used a method called
                    "piggybacking" to gain access to computers when their owners logged in. This gave him access to the computer's
                    protective firewall and allowed him to disable it. <br>
                    Interpol says that Greene has done over $50 million in damage. Most of this damage was done when he used overwriting
                    viruses to overwrite and destroy files on government computer systems. But Greene targeted home computers, too. For these,
                    anti-virus software was unable to stop Greene's viruses because he included anti-antivirus viruses with them. These
                    viruses essentially shut down anti-virus software. Greene is also alleged to have used resident viruses. These viruses imbed
                    themselves in a file or disk drive. When resident extensions are included with them, they become a part of the computer's
                    operating system. This makes them nearly impossible to get rid of. As with all viruses, Greene's viruses are said to have
                    replicated themselves quickly to infect multiple computers,

                    Dear Valued Customer, <br>
                    Recently, a series of identity theft has affected our customers. Unfortunately. this led to severaal instances of
                    fraud occcuring at our bank. The best way to avoid these events is to be informed. Please take a moment
                    to familiarize yourself with some common ways that criminals steal personal information. <br>
                    Card scanning is one simple form of identity theft. This is when someone uses a card scanner to record the 
                    information stored on credit or debit cards. Card scanning can be used to collect passport information as well. <br>
                    Email also presents opportunities for cyber thieves. Spam, or unsolicited emails, can contain malware. This
                    malicious software includes spyware, Trojan horses, and worms that can infect one's computer and steal
                    information. Phising is also conducted over email. This occurs when thieves trick people into giving them

                    Pretexing is similar to phishing but is often done over the phone. Pharming occurs when a hacker redirects
                    someone to a site operated by them. The site looks legitimate and tricks people into giving away personal information. <br>

                    Dear Harper Company Staff, <br>
                    By now, you are all aware of the recent security breach. The IT department has traced it to a bug in
                    our browsers. This bug created an unwanted backdoor in the network, allowing intruders in.
                    The installed keyloggers that track our passwords. <br>
                    The IT department removed the keyloggers, and the software supplier is releasing a patch that will
                    fix this error. We will inform you when this patch becomes available. <br>
                    However, this provides a good opportunity to remind you of the measures we must take to
                    make our network safer. <br>
                    Remember, you must keep the firewall settings as strict as possible on your computer. This
                    prevvents attacks from hackers and keeps certain types of malware out of the system. <br>
                    Be cautious when downloading files. Perform a virus scan on every email attachment. Also, enable
                    your browsers to block popups. Otherwise, spyware can get on to your computer. <br>
                    Only download company-approved programs to your computer. Unauthorized programs may
                    contain Trojans that ccan do irreversible damage to our system. Please consult the IT department
                    for a list of authenticated programs. <br>
                    In addition, we will review our audit logs from now on. This is to make sure no one violates
                    security protocol. Employees violating protocol will receive disciplinary action. <br>

                    Cloud computing provides many businesses with affordable and customizable services. Yet many avoid this
                    technological resource because they don't understand it. This week's column should explain the concept. <br>
                    Cloud computing is a lot like utility computing. However, cloud computing focuses on using the Internet for
                    software and other resources. <br>
                    Cloud computing offers more elasticity and scalability than normal computing. Businesses have access to many
                    resource from both the private and public clouds. Computers ccan easily switch to a new OS with PaaS
                    (platform as a service). They can also switch to a new server with IaaS (infrastructure as a service). <br>
                    Businesses benefit from the pay as you go pricing of cloud computing. And with SaaS (software as a service),
                    the deployment of new software iis almost automatic. It eliminates the need to buy software and install it on every
                    single computer. Furthermore, businesses can monitor their usage and cancel services anytime. <br>
                    Installing a CDN (content delivery network) is a local form of cloud computing that will increase bandwidth. A CDN
                    designates computers on a network for storage. Instead of all computers clogging oone server to retrieve data, each
                    user accesses data on a nearby CDN storage computer. <br>
                    With ccloud ccomputing, businesses get inexpensive solutions to their individual needs.

                    Health technology is a rapidly growing field. New advances aim to improve care and reduce costs. <br>
                    The EHR (Electronic Health Record) is one technology already in place. EHRs let doctors access patient data
                    easily and efficiently. They also enable CDSS (Clinical Decision Support System) functions. These alert doctors to
                    harmful drug interactions. EHRs can also store data from PACS (Picture Archiving and Communications System).
                    Interoperability is a key aspect of EHRs. It lets physicians in different clinics easily share records. <br>
                    Other technology has also become popular. Many doctors use CPOE (Computerized Provider Order Entry) systems.
                    These reduce handwriting and communication errors. Bar coding is another common practice. Here, doctors use
                    optic scanners to match patients to their medicines. They often use ADMs (Automated Dispensing Machines). These
                    dispense drug dosages, which can reduce dosage errors. Many hospitals use EMM (Electronic Material
                    Management) systems. These keep track of drugs and other medical supplies. <br>
                    Some technology is still in development. With the lab-on-a-chip, doctors will not have to send cultures to labs for
                    analysis. Micro robotic tweezers will let doctors operate in very small areas. Implanted microchips will measure
                    and release drug dosages precisely.
