                        DataPro Inc. is growing, and so our workload is increasing. But our IT department is not dealing
                        with this increase effectively. So I am dividing the IT department into three sections: quality
                        assurance, data processing and information security. The reponsibilities of each section are: <br>
                        Quality assurance <br>
                        - Testing hardware <br>
                        - Providing technical support <br>
                        Data processing <br>
                        - Writing code <br>
                        - Organizing data <br>
                        Information Security <br>
                        - Encoding online data transfers <br>
                        - Updating security software <br>
                        These changes are not simple or easy. But smaller groups deal with tasks more efficiently
                        than larger ones. See your supervisors for your new section assignment. <br>

                        Re: TEI Computers? <br>
                        Thanks for including TEI Inc. in your article on workplace
                        technology. We have many types of computers at our disposal.
                        First, all employees receives PDAs, and desktop computers. But we
                        only use those for word processing and spreadsheets. Of course,
                        some programs are too powerful for desktops. So many employees
                        use the faster workstations. And we do have a few laptops and 
                        handheld PCs. However, employees only use them on business
                        trips. Most employees just answer email with their cell phones. The
                        new server provides acceess to all printers. Finally, our mainframe
                        processes our largest data files. No need for a supercomputer yet! <br>
                        Regards, <br>

                        Step #1: First, gather your parts. These include a motherboard, power
                        supply, processor, case, heat sink, fan, RAM, expansion cards, hard
                        drive, and disk drive. <br>

                        Network Troubleshooting <br>
                        People often call IT professionals about network connectiion problems.
                        But many problems are easy to fix without help. First, reconnect any
                        loose CAT-5 cable connections. Next, investigate IP address issues.
                        This group of numbers allows communication on the Internet.
                        Renewing your DHCP fixes most IP problems. Next, check the
                        router. The router links LANs to the Internet. Make sure the
                        router's configuration is correct. WLANs have other problems.
                        Interference often blocks their wireless signals. But there is a
                        simple solution. Just move the router away from walls and
                        metals. Finally, cycle the network. Turn all equipment off for a full minute and then restart.

                        Nowadays, anyone can edit graphics. But new users encounter many difficulties. Here are some common problems and solutions: <br>
                        - Problem: The image is dark or has a strange tint. <br>
                        - Cause: Poor exposure or bad lighting. <br>
                        - Solution: Adjust the contrast using a graphic editing program. <br>
                        - Problem: There is white space around the image. <br>
                        - Solution: Crop the picture. This removes unnecessary parts. <br>
                        - Problem: The photograph is blurry. <br>
                        - Cause: Low resolution. <br>
                        - Solution: Increase the number of pixels in the image. This makes it sharper. Or resize the picture and make it
                        smaller. Also, save the photo as a JPEG file. This format creates high quality photographs.

                        Perform complex queries. Searcch multiple tables for client information. <br>
                        Use our spreadsheets program to: <br>
                        Perform calculations about cost and revenue. Create formulas using different functions and operators. use
                        this to analyze sales data. <br>
                        Create graphs and charts that show profits. Use the data in the cells of a worksheet to create these charts.

                        Mr Smith, <br>
                        At present, we travel a lot to meet with our business partners. I
                        propose that we use videoconferencing instead. It saves time
                        and reduces costs. We only need a webcam to do basic
                        videoconferencing. However, a dedicated system is even better.
                        It allows us to do multipoint videoconferences. And it supports
                        document sharing. It also has an echo-cancellation feature. <br>
                        The system comes with a camera and TV monitor. It also comes
                        with a codec, but we need to order a video bridge separately. We
                        also need to make sure we have high bandwidth Internet access.
                        Still, it offers big savings. Let me know your thoughts. <br>

                        Dear Miss Jackson, <br>
                        Our advertising at brick and mortar gaming shops is not producing video
                        game equipment sales. Those consumers are much more active in
                        e-commerce. So, we at BargainEquipment.com want TFC Gaming to
                        become an affiliate. Our program works in the following manner. You
                        display our banner when customers view their shopping cart. This directs
                        traffic our way. TFC Gaming earns a percentage of sales from that traffic.
                        We pay a smaller percentage for increases in page views without sales. <br>
                        Our FAQs explain that affiliates are not responsible for our products. We
                        do ask that affiliates obtain a digital certificate with our preferred certificate authority. <br>
                        Contact me with any questions. <br>
                        Regards, <br>

                      Certain memory requirements are necessary to install and run ClearPic. Check that the
                      coomputer has at least 500 MB of RAM available. For optimal performance, make sure the computer's
                      CPU has a bit size of at least 32 bits. It should run at a bus speed of 800 MHz. <br>
                      There are sevveral options to fix problems with limited memory. One, is to limit the number of programs running at
                      the same time. <br>
                      Another, is to increase the aamount of RAM. First, determine whether your computer uses SIMMs or DIMMs. Make sure that
                      the memory's bus speed matches that of the computer. Purchase the appropriate amount of RAM
                      and attach it to the motherboard. <br>
                      You can also increase your coomputer's virtual memory. This temporarily stores data on a
                      paging file on the computer's hard drive. To add virtual memory, click on the "My Computer" icon.
                      Under "Properties," increase the maximum memory amount.

                        department's resources. This includes our programmers. Most of our programmers are
                        comfortable with the C, C++, and Java computer languages. We even have one programmer who
                        ccan use C#. But we don't have anyone proficient in Assembler. I think we need some programmers
                        who are familiar with it. That way, we can translate between programs more easily. <br>
                        In addition, we have two programmers who specialize in BASIC. This language is in decline
                        and will probably be phased out soon. <br>
                        Some of our machines are getting older, too. A few computers need their compilers and linkers
                        updated. Otherwise, they'll never be able to convert to machine code efficiently. One of our older CPUs
                        cannot multi-thread very well. As you know, the programming department is very iimportant to this
                        company's future. Please help us stay updated. <br>
                        Thanks, <br>
                        Sarah Jennings

                    Name: Harold Gibbons <br>
                    Department: IT <br>
                    Suggestion: <br>
                    The IT department is in desperate need of new storage devices. To begin, we need a group of hand
                    drives arranged in an array. That means we'll also need RAID software. Just last week, an engineer
                    lost months of data in a drive failure. An array will help us avoid such costly losses in the future. <br>
                    Furthermore, many employees are still using outdated devices like CD-Rs, CCD-RWs and floppy 
                    disks to traansfer files. Providing each engineer with at least a USB flash drive and a zip drive would
                    be much more efficient. Some employees do use their own drives. But state-of-art storage
                    devices should be provided by the company. <br>
                    Finally, GenTech Systems would do well to upgrade the main data backup. We are still using magnetic
                    tape. Even using data compression, the memory storage density of magnetic tape can't compare
                    to modem technology. A 2TB SATA drive could store more data at a fraction of the cost.

                    We have low prices on both inkjet printers and laser printers. Our high-end models have calibration settings for professional-grade
                    photo prints. Some of our models are all-in-one packages that include scanning and fax. <br>
                    We're also selling stand-alone scanners. Scan photoos and documents at resolutions of up to 4800 DPI. Don't forget a transparency adapter
                    for scanning slides. Scanning multiple documents? Pick up an automatic document feeder and let the machine do the work for you. <br>
                    Compumart is staying open late all weekend, just for you. Arrive early to get the hardware you need.

                    Georgiia Electronics is recalling its Model X.1 MP3 players/ An error occurs as the players attempt
                    to decode AAC files. When playlists containing AAC files are opened, the bitrate on aall files
                    slows down. Players will eventually freeze in these situations. <br>
                    This issue also affects the Model X.2 player, but a recall is not necessary. Georgia Electronics has
                    created a drivver to correct the problem in Model X.2 players. This driver may be downloaded free
                    of charge from the company's website. it must then be uploaded to the MP3 player through the
                    included dock. The driver requires less than one gigabyte of capacity on the MP3 plaayer's hard drive. <br>
                    Unfortunately, Model X.1 players will not accept new drivvers and therefore cannot be fixed.
                    Georgia Electronics will refund the full price that consumers paid for the Model X.1. Visit
                    www.georgiaelec.com for details and downloads.

                      Subject: Gaming/Social Networking Markets <br>
                      Gaming and social networking sites offer exciting markets for advertising the new line of Centro
                      computers. Their popularity ensures that many people will view the ads. When people talk together online, we
                      want them to see and discuss the new Centro. <br>
                      A social networking site lets us create a profile and handle related to the new coomputer. We will update
                      people about it in posts that appear in our news feed. We could also have a link to a blog with information
                      about the Centro. People will be able to discuss the computer in a forum that we set up. <br>
                      Gaming sites are another market we should use. Most Massively multiplayer online role-playing games
                      (MMORPG) feature virtual worlds. These worlds allow us to create billboards that advertise our new
                      computers. We can also create avatars relating to the Centro that people can interact with. <br>
                      These sites present unique opportunites for marketing. Please take advantage of them when advertising the new Centro computers.

                      To: Carl [carl@email.com] <br>
                      From: Lisa [lisa@powell-technologies.com] <br>
                      Subject: Technical Problems with New Robot <br>
                      Carl,
                      The robotics team here at Powell Technologies is currently developing an autonomous, serial robot. Its main
                      function is to assist in packaging aand sealing large boxes at factories. However, we are having some technical problems. I
                      know you've worked on robots before. I'm hopiing you have some advice for solving the problem. <br>
                      The robot consists of a manipulator with joints and an end-effector at the top. This acts like a
                      hand. There is an enabling device on the robot that allows it to move. The operator uses a pendant to
                      control the robots actuators. This creates the drive power that makes the robot move. The enabling
                      device appears to be working. But we cannot get the actuators to respond. I looked over the dynamic model
                      and didn't find any errors. Do you think there is a problem with the equality constraint? I would greatly appreciate
                      any help. <br>
                      Thanks, <br>

                    The Monthly Programmer - January Edition <br>
                    Will Heuristics Lead to Consciousness? By Peter Smith<br>
                    Computers perform complex calculations that no human could complete. Yet, they remain unable to
                    think for themselves. That's something cognitive scientists want to change. Their research focuses
                    on two types of thinking: case based and model based reasoning. Case based reasoning
                    compares similar problems. Model based reasoning examines cause and effect. But these different
                    approaches have the same problem. Their algorithms, like most rules, aren't always right. <br>
                    That's where heuristics comes in. With heuristics, computers are avoiding that problem. Instead of
                    following rigid guidelines like regular algorithms, heuristics search for acceptable solutions. As these
                    modified algorithms improve, machine learning leaps forward. Advanced computer agents and
                    robots now find solutions independently. Pattern reccognition has even made computer vision
                    possible. The range of what robots and computerrs can do grows each day. The invention of a self
                    learning computer may soon be possible.
