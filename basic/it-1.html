                        DataPro Inc. is growing, and so our workload is increasing. But our IT department is not dealing
                        with this increase effectively. So I am dividing the IT department into three sections: quality
                        assurance, data processing and information security. The reponsibilities of each section are: <br>
                        Quality assurance <br>
                        - Testing hardware <br>
                        - Providing technical support <br>
                        Data processing <br>
                        - Writing code <br>
                        - Organizing data <br>
                        Information Security <br>
                        - Encoding online data transfers <br>
                        - Updating security software <br>
                        These changes are not simple or easy. But smaller groups deal with tasks more efficiently
                        than larger ones. See your supervisors for your new section assignment. <br>

                        Re: TEI Computers? <br>
                        Thanks for including TEI Inc. in your article on workplace
                        technology. We have many types of computers at our disposal.
                        First, all employees receives PDAs, and desktop computers. But we
                        only use those for word processing and spreadsheets. Of course,
                        some programs are too powerful for desktops. So many employees
                        use the faster workstations. And we do have a few laptops and 
                        handheld PCs. However, employees only use them on business
                        trips. Most employees just answer email with their cell phones. The
                        new server provides acceess to all printers. Finally, our mainframe
                        processes our largest data files. No need for a supercomputer yet! <br>
                        Regards, <br>

                        Step #1: First, gather your parts. These include a motherboard, power
                        supply, processor, case, heat sink, fan, RAM, expansion cards, hard
                        drive, and disk drive. <br>
                        Step #2: Next, Attach the motherboard to the case. Then, connect the
                        processor to the motherboard's primary socket. <br>
                        Step #3: Attach the heat sink and cooling fan to the processor. <br>
                        Step #4: Insert the RAM card into an open memory slot. Put any expansion
                        cards into the expansion slots. <br>
                        Step #5: Connect your hard drive to the motherboard and power supply. <br>
                        Step #6: Close the case and connect the power supply.

                        Network Troubleshooting <br>
                        People often call IT professionals about network connectiion problems.
                        But many problems are easy to fix without help. First, reconnect any
                        loose CAT-5 cable connections. Next, investigate IP address issues.
                        This group of numbers allows communication on the Internet.
                        Renewing your DHCP fixes most IP problems. Next, check the
                        router. The router links LANs to the Internet. Make sure the
                        router's configuration is correct. WLANs have other problems.
                        Interference often blocks their wireless signals. But there is a
                        simple solution. Just move the router away from walls and
                        metals. Finally, cycle the network. Turn all equipment off for a full minute and then restart.

                        Nowadays, anyone can edit graphics. But new users encounter many difficulties. Here are some common problems and solutions: <br>
                        - Problem: The image is dark or has a strange tint. <br>
                        - Cause: Poor exposure or bad lighting. <br>
                        - Solution: Adjust the contrast using a graphic editing program. <br>
                        - Problem: There is white space around the image. <br>
                        - Solution: Crop the picture. This removes unnecessary parts. <br>
                        - Problem: The photograph is blurry. <br>
                        - Cause: Low resolution. <br>
                        - Solution: Increase the number of pixels in the image. This makes it sharper. Or resize the picture and make it
                        smaller. Also, save the photo as a JPEG file. This format creates high quality photographs.

                        Currently, many employees use spreadsheets incorrectly. They are not for data storage. Please review the following guidelines. <br>
                        Use our database program to: <br>
                        Organize and sort large amounts of data regarding client. Enter the client names and addresses into the database fields. <br>
                        Perform complex queries. Searcch multiple tables for client information. <br>
                        Use our spreadsheets program to: <br>
                        Perform calculations about cost and revenue. Create formulas using different functions and operators. use
                        this to analyze sales data. <br>
                        Create graphs and charts that show profits. Use the data in the cells of a worksheet to create these charts.

                        Subject: Purchase Request <br>
                        Mr Smith, <br>
                        At present, we travel a lot to meet with our business partners. I
                        propose that we use videoconferencing instead. It saves time
                        and reduces costs. We only need a webcam to do basic
                        videoconferencing. However, a dedicated system is even better.
                        It allows us to do multipoint videoconferences. And it supports
                        document sharing. It also has an echo-cancellation feature. <br>
                        The system comes with a camera and TV monitor. It also comes
                        with a codec, but we need to order a video bridge separately. We
                        also need to make sure we have high bandwidth Internet access.
                        Still, it offers big savings. Let me know your thoughts. <br>

                        Subject: Lowest Price Affiliate Program <br>
                        Dear Miss Jackson, <br>
                        Our advertising at brick and mortar gaming shops is not producing video
                        game equipment sales. Those consumers are much more active in
                        e-commerce. So, we at BargainEquipment.com want TFC Gaming to
                        become an affiliate. Our program works in the following manner. You
                        display our banner when customers view their shopping cart. This directs
                        traffic our way. TFC Gaming earns a percentage of sales from that traffic.
                        We pay a smaller percentage for increases in page views without sales. <br>
                        Our FAQs explain that affiliates are not responsible for our products. We
                        do ask that affiliates obtain a digital certificate with our preferred certificate authority. <br>
                        Contact me with any questions. <br>
                        Regards, <br>
