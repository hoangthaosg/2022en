1. Describe a TV program (TV serires) you ahve watched. <br><br>
- I'm going to (gonna) talk about "The suite life of Zack and Cody". <br>
Well, unlike kids nowadays who have tons of ways to entertain themselves, back in 2005, we were totally glued to the Disney Channel, a popular channel for kids that is loved by adults as well. <br>
Not only me but also my siblings love this channel and we often watch it together in family gatherings. <br><br>
- This channel has several programs. <br>
And one of our favorite comedy shows back then was "The Suite Life of Zack and Cody", which starred the lovable twins Dylan and Code Sprouse living. <br>
Lasting three seasons, the show even had a spin-off. <br>
In the 4 parts, Zack was a funny character and Cody was the smart one. <br>
Apart from the two main characters, this program had lots of other supporting characters and each has their own distinctive personality, which gave the program a wide audience appeal. <br><br>
- I have to (hafta) admit that the main reason I was a big fan of this program was not because of Zack and Cody but a side character - London Tipton, who was an obvious parody of the socialite Paris Hilton. <br>
She appeared in almost every episode of "The Suite Life of Zack and Cody" and was presented as a ditzy, privileged girl with hidden depth. <br><br>
- Another reason is that I learned countless new things by watching this show. <br>
At the age of 13, I learned about how some Western people bring up their offspring. <br> 
I was impressed by the way thet treat and talk to their children as a friend, which helps a lot of to bridge the generation gap and make family relationships much more intimate.
