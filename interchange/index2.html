<h3>01. A time to remember</h3>
<p>
    T: Oh, I'm really sorry. Are you OK? <br>
    A: I'm fine. But I'm not very good at this. <br>
    T: Neither am I... Hey, I like your shirt. Are you from Argentina? <br>
    A: Yes, I am, originally. I was born there. <br>
    T: Did you grow up there? <br>
    A: Yes, I did, but my family moved here 10 years ago, when I was in middle school. <br>
    T: And where did you learn to skate? <br>
    A: Here in the park. This is only my third time. <br>
    T: Well, it's my first time. Can you give me some lessons? <br>
    A: Sure. Just follow me. <br>
    T: By the way, my name is Ted. <br>
    A: And I'm Ana. Nice to meet you. <br>
    --- <br>
    T: Hey, that was fun. Thanks for the lesson! <br>
    A: No problem. So, tell me a little about yourself. What do you do? <br>
    T: I work in a travel agency. <br>
    A: Really! What do you do there? <br>
    T: I'm in charge of their computers. <br>
    A: Oh. so you're a computer specialist. <br>
    T: Well, sort of. Yeah, I guess so. <br>
    A: That's great. Then maybe you can give me some help with a computer course I'm taking. <br>
    T: Oh, sure... but only if you promise to give me some more skating lessons. <br>
    A: It's a deal!
