<h3>01. That's what friends are for!</h3>
<p>
    C: Do you have a date for your friend's wedding yet? <br>
    K: Actually, no, I don't... Do you know anyone I could go with? <br>
    C: Hmm. What kind of guys do you like? <br>
    K: Oh, I like guys who aren't too serious and who have a good sense of humor. You know, someone like you. <br>
    C: OK. Uh, waht else? <br>
    K: Well, I'd prefer someone I have somthing in common with - whi I can talk to easily. <br>
    C: I think I know just the guy for you. Bob Branson. Do you know him? <br>
    K: No, I don't think so. <br>
    C: OK, I'll ask him to meet us for coffee, and you can tell me what you think. <br>
    --- <br>
    C: So, what's the verdict? What did you think of Bob? <br>
    K: Well, I was worried at first - especially when I saw that he rode a huge motorcycle. I thought he might be one of those guys who is into heavy metal music and stuff like that. You know what I mean? <br>
    C: But he's just a regular kind of guy, right? <br>
    K: Yeah, we got along really well! <br>
    C: I knew you'd like him. <br>
    K: Yeah, I do. And he's really funny. He had me laughing so hard at the coffee shop, remember? I think people sitting next to us thought  we were crazy. <br>
    C: So are you two going to get together again? <br>
    K: Definitely. In fact, we're going to the wedding together! <br>
    C: That's great!
