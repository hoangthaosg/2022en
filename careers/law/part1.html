<hr>

    <p>1. What are some different jobs in the legal profession? <br>
        Judge, attorney/lawyer, paralegal, clerk of the court, bailiff.
    </p>

    <p>2. Which legal job would you prefer, and why? <br>
        I would like to be a judge. 
        I think it would be much less stressful than being an attorney, because you don't have to worry about winning your case.
        However you still get to work in a court and hear lots of interesting cases.
