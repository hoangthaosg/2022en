<h3>1. Money</h3>
<span class="question">1. What do people use to make purchases in your country?</span>
<div>
    In my country most people use credit and debit cards to make purchases. 
    However, most people also carry cash and loose change in order to buy smaller items. 
    Checks are sometimes used to pay bills.
</div>
<br>
<span class="question">2. Are coins or bills more common in your country? Which do you prefer?</span> 
<div>
    Bills are more common in my country than coins. 
    I prefer them because they are not heavy and they can be used to pay for almost anything. 
    Coins can only be used to purchase small items because it is difficult to carry large amounts of them around, 
    and most shops will not allow you to buy expensive items with them.
</div>

    Tourist: Here you go. <br>
    Teller: Twenty, forty, sixty. The total comes to one hundred and seventy euros. <br>
    Tourist: How much is that in dollars?<br>
    Teller: I'll calculate that now. It comes to two hundred and thirty-five dollars and seventeen cents. <br>
