        Subject: Call Center Equipment <br><br>
        Hello Raymond, <br> <br>
        I reviewed the call center inventory. We have extra computers, keyboards, and mice. We don't need to order any of these.
        I don't think we need any more notepads either. We have plenty of calculators right now. Don't order any unless they are on sale. <br>
        I definitely need you to order a new whiteboard. The one we have now is really old and dirty. We also need new phones and headsets for the terminals. <br>
        Also, can you get prices on new display monitors? I'd like to get one. However, I don't know if we have the budget for it. Thanks. <br><br>
