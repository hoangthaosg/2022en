                            Mr. and Mrs. Peters went to Briston for a holiday last summer.
                            <br/>Briston is a town by the sea in England.
                            <br/>Mr. Peters likes fishing very much, and on the first day he said to his wife
                            <br/>"I'm going to go out fishing on the sea. Are you going to come with me?"
                            <br/>"No", his wife answered. "It's cold and windy today."
                            <br/>Mr. Peters went out in a boat alone and fished for several hours, but he caught nothing - 
                            <br/>except an advertisement on a piece of plastic for a fish-shop in the town.
                            <br/>He went back to the hotel and gave it to his wife.
                            <br/>"How did you catch that?" she asked him.
                            <br/>"A diver put it on my hook." Mr Peters answered.
